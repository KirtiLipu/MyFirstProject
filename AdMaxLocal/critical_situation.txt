order creates but ads were not created in SE and the status of the order went to ERROR in AML platform:
Reason: ads were not created in AdWords only campaigns were being created.

Sol: First we tried with the normal test and followed the same procedue which we used to follow for the error orders before. I did the background mapping in databases whatever data were missing, then successfully deployed the order. Then verified the accounts in SE and found out the problem was in ads creation. 

Helped with the developer team ,informed them regarding these issues and also raised a bug on it, dev team worked in these issues and changed the neccesary code in the build, a moment after, Dev team send us the modified build, and then suddenly we pushed these builds to all production systems, Then we again deployed the affected orders directly and after that every order had successfully deployed in our platform and in SE as well.




special charachter issues comes in orders after server maintainance . IT teams forget to restart one process after the maintainance, 
grabeled charachter shows for the special charachter in platform, 

Sol: first we tried saving order with the special charachter and checked the log for more clarification, then we restarted all services and then we tried the same things, but this time no issues.
Due to not restarting one of service the character set process failed to load after maintainance. From their we got to know and list out the all require testing if their is small changes in production.
